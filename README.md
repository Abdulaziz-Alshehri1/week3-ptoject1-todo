# Task 
The To-Do Application must display tasks in a list.
Each entry in the list should display:
1. The task’s title
2. An indication of whether the task is completed
3. The task’s due date, if one has been provided by the user
○ If the task is past due, an indication of this fact
If the user taps on the cell, they should see a screen for editing additional task details, including:
4. All of the information listed on each task (in the list above)
5. The creation date (not editable)
6. An extended description where the user can provide more details about the task
The user must be able to add, delete and edit tasks.
The data for the to do list must be persistent. No data should be lost if the user terminates and
relaunches the application, or if the user reboots their device.

## Ideas for extra credit 
1. Let the user mark the tasks complete from the list
2. Show the user an alert if saving or loading fails unexpectedly
3. Sorting and filtering of tasks
